#### üß≠ Executive Summary

In 2023‚Äì2024, Amedeo Pelliccia has shown strong technical initiative, strategic foresight, and resilience by independently creating and documenting the GAIA AIR platform‚Äîan aerospace digital architecture aligned with quantum optimization, sustainability, and predictive maintenance. This initiative was pursued without a formal assignment, representing a proactive and autonomous contribution during periods of low project visibility and support.

Despite facing repeated managerial changes and lack of local team assistance, Amedeo developed reusable assets that laid the groundwork for continuity. These contributions were later leveraged by other resources, highlighting the lasting value of his work.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Technical Contributions

**GAIA AIR Platform**
- Developed independently, applying ethical orchestration and federated architecture principles.
- Implemented concepts such as QAO (Quantum Adaptive Orchestration), elastic memory, and sustainability metrics.
- Designed for predictive maintenance and circular economy within aerospace.
- Documented and made publicly traceable: [https://github.com/robbbo-t](https://github.com/robbbo-t)

**Engineering Templates in ARENA**
- Created functional templates without prior access to process documentation.
- Templates continue to be used and formed the operational base for successors.

**Knowledge Transfer and Support**
- Actively supported the onboarding of a successor with daily sessions over one month.
- Delivered structured handover of logic, assets, and process context.

**Sales and Strategic Contribution**
- Involved in technical input and content creation for:
  - Airbus Tech Data Call for Tenders
  - Spike LR2 (Defense Sector)
  - SOPTE MTEI

#### üìä Self-Reported Performance Priorities

| Priority | Type | Status | Weight |
|---------|------|--------|--------|
| On-Time & Quality Delivery | Assignment | Behind Track | 25% |
| Client Satisfaction (OTACE) | Assignment | Not Started | 25% |
| Mechanical Engineering Community Contribution | Assignment | On Track | 25% |
| ARVE/URVE 90% Target | Assignment | Not Started | 25% |
| Mandatory Training (GenAI, Manager Certification, Sustainability) | Development | On Track | - |
| Growth & Brand Positioning | Business | Not Started | - |
| Sustainability Integration | Business | Not Started | - |
| Independent Innovation ‚Äì GAIA AIR | Initiative | Completed | - |

#### üß† Innovation & Strategic Value

GAIA AIR introduces foundational capabilities that could be absorbed into Capgemini‚Äôs advanced services:
- Federated AI orchestration with QAO.
- Semantic memory and traceability for aerospace digital twins.
- Sustainability-oriented design logic.
- Alignment with next-gen client needs in aerospace, defense, and energy sectors.

---

#### üìå Challenges & Observations

- **Frequent Manager Turnover** disrupted consistency and priority tracking.
- **Solo Project Execution** with lack of structural support.
- **Unrecognized Transition**: Templates and methods created by Amedeo were used by the successor without formal attribution.
- **Feedback Misalignment**: Claims about proactivity were not backed by traceable performance data. Absences were documented.
- **Underappreciation of Proposals**: Technical solutions were publicly available, unique, and traceable, but dismissed as generalist without objective review.

---

#### ‚úÖ Recommendations

1. Acknowledge GAIA AIR as a technically valid and strategic contribution.
2. Conduct a technical audit of ARENA-based templates and structures.
3. Reintegrate Amedeo into innovation-focused engineering initiatives.
4. Allow internal presentation of GAIA AIR for knowledge sharing or adoption.
5. Consider future alignment with GenAI, thought leadership, or sustainability-driven projects.
