It seems that there was an issue retrieving the repository contents using the GitHub API tool. Let's verify and create the structure of the directories and other files manually.

Below is the complete structure and content of the files as described:

````markdown name=adaptation-layer/README.md
# Adaptation Layer

This layer translates between different API protocols and formats. It allows a client request in one protocol (e.g., REST) to reach a service that communicates in another protocol (e.g., SOAP or GraphQL).

## Key Features
- Protocol translation and request/response mapping
- Configurable transformation rules
- Error handling and logging

## Running the Examples
```bash
npm run start:adaptation
```
````

````markdown name=microservices-facades/README.md
# Microservices with API Facades

This approach implements microservices with multiple API facades, exposing the same core business logic through different interface styles (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, etc.).

## Key Features
- Decouples external interfaces from internal service logic
- Enables multiple parallel interfaces for the same domain
- Simplifies external client usage

## Running the Examples
```bash
npm run start:facades
```
````

````markdown name=transformation-framework/README.md
# Transformation Framework

This framework provides a rules-driven way to transform data between various formats and structures. It simplifies mappings between JSON, XML, and other data representations.

## Key Features
- Declarative transformation rules
- Supports complex one-to-many mappings
- Streamlined data conversion

## Running the Examples
```bash
npm run start:transformation
```
````

````markdown name=metadata-driven-approach/README.md
# Metadata-Driven Approach

In this approach, API endpoints are generated dynamically based on metadata configurations. It provides a fast way to spin up multiple API styles (e.g., REST, GraphQL) from a single metadata source.

## Key Features
- Single metadata defines multiple endpoint types
- Simplifies maintenance across multiple APIs
- Customizable generation logic

## Running the Examples
```bash
npm run start:metadata
```
````

````markdown name=api-orchestration/README.md
# API Orchestration System

This system chains multiple API calls into a single orchestrated flow, reducing client complexity by centralizing workflows on the server side.

## Key Features
- Combined or sequential API calls in a single request
- Data transformation between steps
- Error handling and retry strategies

## Running the Examples
```bash
npm run start:orchestration
```
````

```json name=package.json
