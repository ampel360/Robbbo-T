# TLS-UTidS Specification v0.1

## 1. Purpose

The TLS-UTidS (Terminal Logical Sequence of Universally Technology Identifiable Significance) defines a universal identity model that merges symbolic, technical, and empathic layers. It enables interoperable, traceable, and emotionally aware identities across intelligent federated systems.

## 2. Structure

Each TLS identifier follows the format:

```
[CoreCode:DescriptiveTitle]_[Context]#[EmoCode]
```

This allows a fusion of functional clarity, narrative awareness, and emotional state in one symbolic ID.

## 3. Field Breakdown

### tls_core

- `code`: Shorthand identifier (e.g., BOT, APP, SYS)
- `title`: Human-readable title (e.g., Empathic Agent)
- `type`: General category (e.g., Agent, Application, Module)

### context

- `domain`: Operational or thematic domain (e.g., edu, aero)
- `description`: Expanded use-case or deployment environment

### emo_code

- `tag`: Emotion signature (e.g., rqst, grtf, empx)
- `description`: Explanation of affective intent

### state

- `lifecycle`: Status (init, active, drifting, archived)
- `decay_status`: Temporal relevance indicator (stable, decaying, obsolete)
- `federation_link`: Path in the federated architecture (e.g., GAIA-AIR/NODE-31B)

### xai

- `explainability`: Level of semantic transparency (low/medium/high)
- `mission_alignment`: Boolean for alignment with ethical/systemic goals

### observability

- `prom_label`: Label for Prometheus monitoring
- `grafana_tag`: Tag for UI display in observability tools

### metadata

- `created_by`: Issuing authority (e.g., TLS-FNA)
- `creation_date`: UTC date of issuance
- `linked_components`: Associated technical or logical references

### yield

- `field`: Application domain or sector (e.g., IA-Robotics)
- `class`: Functional classification or innovation group
- `productivity_signal`: Observed or estimated gain
- `emotional_feedback_loop`: Boolean or configuration
- `learning_curve`: Nature of skill acquisition or system adaptation
- `federation_score`: Current evaluation within federation (scale 0–100)
- `resilience`: Operational resilience (low/medium/high)

## 4. Compliance

Conformance to **COAFI Part VI** is mandatory. TLS-UTidS must be registered, verifiable, and resolvable across system boundaries.

## 5. Governance

All TLS IDs are governed by the **Federated Naming Authority (TLS-FNA)**, ensuring uniqueness, role coherence, and ethical signaling. Lifecycle hooks are embedded for dynamic updates.

## 6. Integration

TLS-UTidS is interoperable with:

- `Ampel_LegendIARY` and `.ampel` files
- AMPIDE environment and agent runtime specs
- PETCORE memory layers
- QAO execution maps
- DEF (Decisión Empática Federada)
- COAFI-XAI documentation flows

## 7. Astronautic Component Reference

### 7.1. Planificación de Misión Espacial

➤ `SYS:Mission Planner_space#cmln`: System for mission planning in calm federated state, optimized for orbital decision flows.

### 7.2. Diseño Espacial

➤ `MOD:Spaceframe Designer_space#rqst`: Module for spacecraft structural layout under request mode, adaptive to mission constraints.

### 7.3. Entorno Espacial

➤ `SYS:Radiation Simulator_space#mntc`: System simulating space radiation conditions, currently in maintenance recalibration.

### 7.4. Sistemas de Soporte Vital

➤ `APP:Life Support Manager_space#empx`: Application managing crew conditions with empathic adaptation based on biosignal feedback.

### 7.5. Mecánica Orbital

➤ `CMP:Orbital Dynamics Engine_space#cmln`: Compiler for orbital maneuver analysis, operating in calm and stable federated alignment.

### 7.6. Telemetría y Reacción Ética

➤ `SYS:Cognitive Core_space#empx`: Central logic system that processes sensor input using thermal models and system state evaluation, enabling traceable ethical reactions.

➤ `MOD:XAI Reactive Filter_space#mntc`: Module that receives decisions from the cognitive core and encodes them with ethical reasoning for operational reaction (preventive, corrective, or adaptive).

➤ `SNS:Sensor Mesh_space#live`: Network of real-time telemetry devices (e.g., temperature, power), streaming to AMPEL core for decision shaping.

## 8. Operational Modes

| Mode        | Description                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| live        | Fully operational and active agent/system         |
| ghost       | Dormant, archived, or symbolic-only instance      |
| maintenance | Under recalibration or restricted function        |
| proposal    | Draft or pending identifier awaiting registration |
| archived    | Deprecated, superseded, or intentionally frozen   |

## 9. Empathic Ontology Index (TLS-EI)

All TLS identifiers are linked to an evolving **ontology graph** that maps emotional state (`emo_code`), functional category (`tls_core`), and federated role (`context.domain`).

This empowers semantic routing, empathic analytics, and symbolic observability across complex federated architectures.
