## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document provides the master overview and unified index for the entire GAIA Documentation Ecosystem, encompassing both GAIA AIR and GAIA SPACE programs. It establishes a clear, non-redundant structure separating **Common** foundational/supporting documentation from **Domain-Specific** documentation for Air and Space platforms.

The purpose is to establish a single entry point for navigating all technical documentation, standards, and project artifacts, ensuring consistency, traceability, and support for advanced knowledge management across all GAIA platforms.

## 2. Foundational Framework Components

The GAIA Documentation Ecosystem is built upon:

*   **Common Documentation Parts (GP-FD, CN, GB, SUPL, RAME, PM, DS, DIMENSIONS, RS):** Foundational principles, shared digital services, Industry 5.0 aspects, project management, and standards applicable across domains. *(See Section 5)*
*   **GAIA AIR Specific Documentation (AToC Structure - Part I: ATA 00-99):** Documentation specific to Air platforms, organized by ATA chapters. *(See Section 6)*
*   **GAIA SPACE Specific Documentation (SToC Structure - Parts: SS, MO, SE, LS, SR):** Documentation specific to Space platforms, organized by SNS chapters. *(See Section 7)*
*   **GAIA Aerospace Table of Program Content Ontology (GASTOP-CO2):** The semantic layer defining content meaning and relationships. *(Refer to `GASToP-CO2` document)*
*   **GAIA-CO-ASD-LIB Standard:** Common standards for file formats, naming, and metadata. *(See Section 4)*
*   **Unified INFOCODE Index:** Common codes classifying document purpose. *(See Section 3)*

## 3. Unified INFOCODE-INDEX

*(This index defines the standard document types used across the ecosystem)*

*End of Unified Overview & Master Index (v1.5 - Reworked)*
```

This **v1.5** structure provides:

1.  A clear separation between Common, Air-Specific (AToC), and Space-Specific (SToC) documentation parts.
2.  Unified handling of Project Management and other cross-cutting concerns within the Common Parts.
3.  A top-level outline for each Part and Chapter/SNS Code, indicating where detailed document lists (like those generated previously for specific ATA/SNS chapters) should reside (linked via placeholder `index.md` files for now).
4.  Consistent application of the foundational standards (InfoCodes, Naming, Metadata).

This structure should be much cleaner and serve as a better foundation. Please let me know your next request based on this reworked index.
