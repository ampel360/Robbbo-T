## 3. Metadata & Documentation Standards

To maintain documentation integrity, GAIA AIR employs a **structured metadata convention** ensuring interoperability across digital tools.

**File-naming standard**
`[Project]-[Domain]-[Chapter]-[Section]-[Subject]-[InfoCode]-[Variant]`

Example → `GAIA-AIR-01-10-DesignPhilosophy-SPEC-A.yaml` (Design philosophy, variant A).

Each file must include the **GAIA-CO-ASD-LIB metadata block** with fields for `title`, `documentID`, `revision`, `date`, `status`, `applicability`, `authors`, and so on.

---

## 4. AI & Automation Integration

* **AI-enhanced safety monitoring** for ethical compliance.
* **Automated regulatory updates** via NLP-driven certification tracking.
* **Semantic search embeddings** for fast retrieval of references.
* **Predictive maintenance analytics** aligned with sustainability goals.

## 5. Revision Control & Future Expansions

Current version **Rev 0.1 (2025-05-05)** — initial content added and document structure established.
Pending expert review for regulatory alignment and AI index validation.
