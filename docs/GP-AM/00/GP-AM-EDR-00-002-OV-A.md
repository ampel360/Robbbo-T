## 2. COAFI Framework Fundamentals

### 2.1 Framework Overview

The COAFI framework is a systems engineering methodology developed specifically for the integration of disparate technologies in next-generation aircraft. It extends traditional systems engineering approaches to address the unique challenges of integrating quantum technologies with conventional aerospace systems.

The framework is built on five core principles:

1. **Hierarchical Decomposition**: Systems are decomposed into progressively more detailed subsystems, components, and parts
2. **Functional Allocation**: Functions are allocated to physical components in a traceable manner
3. **Interface Standardization**: Interfaces between systems are standardized and formally controlled
4. **Operational Integration**: Operational scenarios drive integration requirements
5. **Verification Continuity**: Verification activities span all levels of integration

### 2.2 Framework Structure

The COAFI framework consists of four interconnected domains:

1. **Operational Domain**: Defines how the aircraft is used and operated
2. **Functional Domain**: Defines what the aircraft must do to fulfill operational needs
3. **Physical Domain**: Defines the physical implementation of functions
4. **Verification Domain**: Defines how compliance is demonstrated

These domains are connected through a series of transformations:
- Operational needs are transformed into functional requirements
- Functional requirements are allocated to physical components
- Physical components are verified against functional requirements
- Functional requirements are validated against operational needs

### 2.3 COAFI in the Aircraft Lifecycle

The COAFI framework spans the entire aircraft lifecycle:

- **Concept Phase**: Establishing operational needs and high-level functions
- **Definition Phase**: Detailed functional decomposition and allocation
- **Development Phase**: Physical implementation and interface control
- **Production Phase**: Integration and verification
- **Operation Phase**: Performance monitoring and feedback
- **Disposal Phase**: Safe decommissioning and recycling

## 4. Functional Requirements Allocation

### 4.1 Allocation Methodology

The COAFI framework employs a systematic approach to allocating functional requirements to physical components:

1. **Function Identification**: Identifying all functions required to fulfill operational needs
2. **Function Analysis**: Analyzing functions to determine inputs, outputs, and constraints
3. **Function Allocation**: Assigning functions to physical components
4. **Allocation Verification**: Ensuring all functions are allocated and all components have functions
5. **Traceability Establishment**: Creating bidirectional traceability between functions and components

### 4.2 Allocation Matrix

The allocation of functions to physical components is documented in the Functional Allocation Matrix. This matrix maps each function from the FBS to one or more components in the PBS.

A simplified excerpt of the Functional Allocation Matrix for the propulsion system is provided below:

| Function ID | Function Description | Primary Component | Supporting Components |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| FBS-2110 | Generate Primary Thrust | PBS-2110 (QEE Core) | PBS-2140, PBS-2150 |
