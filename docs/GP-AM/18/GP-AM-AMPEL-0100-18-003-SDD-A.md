## 1. Introduction

This document describes the concept and functional aspects of the AI-Driven Vibration Anomaly Detection System, a core capability provided by the i-Aher0 AI Core (Ref: [`GP-CN-AI-XXX-XX-XXX-X`](https://github.com/Robbbo-T/Robbbo-T/blob/main/docs/GP-CN/XX/GP-CN-AI-XXX-XX-XXX-X.md)), utilizing data from the onboard Vibration Monitoring System (HUMS - Ref: [`GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-18-002-SDD-A`](https://github.com/Robbbo-T/Robbbo-T/blob/main/docs/GP-AM/18/GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-18-002-SDD-A.md)). The system aims to automatically identify deviations from normal vibration patterns, indicating potential component degradation or incipient failures.

## 2. System Purpose

The primary goals of the AI-Driven Vibration Anomaly Detection System are:
*   Enhance safety by providing early warning of potential mechanical failures.
*   Enable condition-based and predictive maintenance (Ref: [`GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-05-004-SDD-A`](https://github.com/Robbbo-T/Robbbo-T/blob/main/docs/GP-AM/05/GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-05-004-SDD-A.md)).
*   Reduce unscheduled maintenance events and associated costs.
*   Improve diagnostic accuracy for maintenance personnel.

## 3. Functional Description

*   **Data Ingestion:** Receives processed or raw vibration data streams from the HUMS DAUs via the CMS or directly from the avionics network.
*   **Feature Extraction:** Applies signal processing techniques (e.g., advanced spectral analysis, wavelet transforms, statistical analysis) to extract relevant features from the vibration data.
*   **Baseline Modeling:** Establishes models of normal vibration behavior for different components under various operating conditions (flight phase, power setting, etc.), potentially using machine learning techniques on historical data.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Compares real-time vibration features against the established baseline models. Utilizes algorithms (e.g., clustering, classification, outlier detection) to identify statistically significant deviations or patterns indicative of anomalies.
*   **Fault Signature Recognition (Conceptual):** Aims to correlate specific anomaly patterns with known failure modes or fault signatures (e.g., bearing spalling, gear tooth damage, imbalance) using trained AI models.
*   **Alert Generation & Reporting:** Generates alerts for detected anomalies, potentially classifying severity. Provides diagnostic information and context to the CMS (Ref: [`GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-45-XXX-X`](https://github.com/Robbbo-T/Robbbo-T/blob/main/docs/GP-AM/45/GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-45-XXX-X.md)) for maintenance logging and crew alerting (Ref: [`GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-31-XXX-X`](https://github.com/Robbbo-T/Robbbo-T/blob/main/docs/GP-AM/31/GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-31-XXX-X.md)). Contributes data to the adaptive maintenance scheduling system (Ref: [`GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-05-003-SDD-A`](https://github.com/Robbbo-T/Robbbo-T/blob/main/docs/GP-AM/05/GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-05-003-SDD-A.md)).

## 4. Conceptual AI Logic

The system leverages machine learning models trained on both nominal and (where available) fault condition data. Techniques may include:
*   Supervised learning for classifying known fault types.
*   Unsupervised learning (e.g., autoencoders, clustering) for detecting novel or unexpected deviations from normal operation.
*   Time-series analysis for trend monitoring and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation (links to PDM).

## 5. Key Interfaces

*   **Vibration Monitoring System (HUMS - 18-002):** Primary data source. (Ref: [`GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-18-002-SDD-A`](https://github.com/Robbbo-T/Robbbo-T/blob/main/docs/GP-AM/18/GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-18-002-SDD-A.md))
*   **Central Maintenance System (CMS - ATA 45):** Interface for receiving data, logging results, generating maintenance messages. (Ref: [`GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-45-XXX-X`](https://github.com/Robbbo-T/Robbbo-T/blob/main/docs/GP-AM/45/GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-45-XXX-X.md))
*   **AI Core (i-Aher0 - GP-CN-AI):** Hosts the algorithms and models. (Ref: [`GP-CN-AI-XXX-XX-XXX-X`](https://github.com/Robbbo-T/Robbbo-T/blob/main/docs/GP-CN/XX/GP-CN-AI-XXX-XX-XXX-X.md))
*   **Flight Data Systems (ATA 31/FMS):** Provides operational context (flight phase, altitude, speed, power settings) for baseline modeling. (Ref: [`GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-31-XXX-X`](https://github.com/Robbbo-T/Robbbo-T/blob/main/docs/GP-AM/31/GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-31-XXX-X.md))
*   **Predictive Maintenance System (05-004):** Shares anomaly data and potentially receives RUL estimates. (Ref: [`GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-05-004-SDD-A`](https://github.com/Robbbo-T/Robbbo-T/blob/main/docs/GP-AM/05/GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-05-004-SDD-A.md))

## 6. Data Requirements

*   High-fidelity, timestamped vibration data from HUMS.
*   Synchronized aircraft operational parameters (flight phase, engine settings, etc.).
*   Historical vibration data (nominal and fault conditions, if available) for model training.
*   Maintenance records for correlating detected anomalies with actual findings (feedback loop).
