## 1. Scope

This document specifies the requirements for passive acoustic liners used for noise absorption and transmission loss within the AMPEL360XWLRGA airframe, primarily within the fuselage structure (Ref: [`GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-53-XXX-X`](https://github.com/Robbbo-T/Robbbo-T/blob/main/docs/GP-AM/53/GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-53-XXX-X.md)) and potentially engine nacelles (Ref: [`GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-54-XXX-X`](https://github.com/Robbbo-T/Robbbo-T/blob/main/docs/GP-AM/54/GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-54-XXX-X.md)). These liners complement the Active Noise Cancellation system (Ref: [`GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-18-004-SDD-A`](https://github.com/Robbbo-T/Robbbo-T/blob/main/docs/GP-AM/18/GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-18-004-SDD-A.md)) by addressing broader frequency ranges and providing baseline noise reduction.

*   [`GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-53-XXX-X`](https://github.com/Robbbo-T/Robbbo-T/blob/main/docs/GP-AM/53/GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-53-XXX-X.md): Fuselage Structural Documents

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1. Acoustic Performance

*   **Absorption Coefficient:** Minimum absorption coefficient targets across specified frequency bands (e.g., 1/3 octave bands from 250 Hz to 8000 Hz). Values TBD based on acoustic analysis and target cabin noise levels.
*   **Transmission Loss:** Minimum sound transmission loss (STL) targets across specified frequency bands to reduce noise ingress from external sources (engine, aerodynamic). Values TBD.
*   **Performance Verification:** Acoustic performance shall be verified through standardized testing methods (e.g., impedance tube testing, reverberation room testing) on material samples and potentially full-scale panel tests.

### 3.2. Physical Properties

*   **Material Type:** Specify approved materials (e.g., fiberglass blankets, acoustic foams, perforated liners with honeycomb core). Materials must meet flammability requirements (Ref: FAR 25.853).
*   **Density/Weight:** Maximum allowable weight per unit area (areal density) to minimize impact on aircraft weight. Target value TBD.
*   **Thickness:** Dimensional constraints based on available installation space within fuselage frames or nacelle structures.
*   **Environmental Resistance:** Liners must withstand operational temperature ranges, humidity, potential fluid contamination, and vibration without degradation of acoustic or physical properties.

### 3.3. Installation

*   **Attachment Method:** Specify approved methods for securing liners to the primary structure (e.g., mechanical fasteners, adhesives, retainers).
*   **Sealing:** Requirements for sealing edges and penetrations to prevent noise flanking paths.
*   **Maintainability:** Liners should be designed for reasonable access and replacement during maintenance activities.

### 3.4. Durability

*   Liners shall maintain their specified acoustic and physical properties for a defined service life (TBD).
*   Resistance to damage from typical cabin environment or maintenance activities.

## 4. Quality Assurance

*   Material certifications required from suppliers.
*   Incoming inspection procedures for acoustic liners.
*   Installation verification checks during aircraft assembly.
