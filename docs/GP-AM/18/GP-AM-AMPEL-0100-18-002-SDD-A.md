## 1. Introduction

This document provides a system description for the Vibration Monitoring function of the Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) installed on the AMPEL360XWLRGA airframe. The primary purpose of this subsystem is to acquire vibration data from critical rotating machinery and structural locations to support health monitoring, diagnostics, and predictive maintenance.

## 2. System Overview

The Vibration Monitoring System comprises a network of sensors strategically placed on the aircraft, data acquisition units, and interfaces to the Central Maintenance System (CMS - Ref: `[GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-45-XXX-X](github.com/robbbo-t/docs/GP-AM/45/...)`) and potentially directly to the AI Core (i-Aher0 - Ref: `[GP-CN-AI-XXX-XX-XXX-X](github.com/robbbo-t/docs/GP-CN/XX/...)`) for analysis (Ref: `[GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-18-003-SDD-A](github.com/robbbo-t/docs/GP-AM/18/GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-18-003-SDD-A.md)`).

## 3. Functional Description

*   **Sensing:** Continuously measures vibration levels (acceleration, velocity, or displacement) across relevant frequency spectra at monitored locations.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Collects raw sensor data, performs initial signal conditioning (filtering, amplification), and digitizes the signals.
*   **Data Processing (Basic):** May perform onboard calculations like RMS levels, peak values, or basic spectral analysis (e.g., FFT) for immediate threshold monitoring or efficient data transmission.
*   **Data Transmission:** Transmits processed or raw vibration data to the CMS for recording and further analysis by ground systems or the onboard AI.

## 4. System Architecture

*   **Sensors:**
    *   Type: Primarily piezoelectric accelerometers, potentially velocity sensors or proximity probes depending on the application.
    *   Locations (Conceptual): Engine bearings, gearboxes (engine, APU), rotor systems (if applicable), key structural points (wing roots, fuselage frames). Specific locations TBD based on design analysis.
*   **Data Acquisition Units (DAUs):** Distributed units located near sensor clusters to minimize wiring length. Perform signal conditioning and digitization.
*   **Wiring Harness:** Dedicated, shielded wiring connecting sensors to DAUs and DAUs to the CMS/avionics network.
*   **Interface:** Data output typically via standard avionics buses (e.g., ARINC 429, Ethernet) to the CMS (Ref: `[GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-45-XXX-X](github.com/robbbo-t/docs/GP-AM/45/...)`).

## 5. Key Interfaces

*   **Central Maintenance System (CMS - ATA 45):** Primary interface for data logging, configuration management, and initiating built-in tests (BIT). (Ref: `[GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-45-XXX-X](github.com/robbbo-t/docs/GP-AM/45/...)`)
*   **AI Core (i-Aher0 - GP-CN-AI / 18-003):** Receives vibration data for advanced anomaly detection and diagnostics. (Ref: `[GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-18-003-SDD-A](github.com/robbbo-t/docs/GP-AM/18/GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-18-003-SDD-A.md)`, `[GP-CN-AI-XXX-XX-XXX-X](github.com/robbbo-t/docs/GP-CN/XX/...)`)
*   **Electrical Power System (ATA 24):** Provides power to sensors and DAUs. (Ref: `[GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-24-XXX-X](github.com/robbbo-t/docs/GP-AM/24/...)`)
*   **Indicating System (ATA 31):** May receive alerts generated based on vibration data analysis for crew notification. (Ref: `[GP-AM-AMPEL-0100-31-XXX-X](github.com/robbbo-t/docs/GP-AM/31/...)`)

## 6. Data Parameters (Conceptual)

*   Raw vibration time waveforms.
*   Processed vibration levels (RMS, peak).
*   Frequency spectra (FFT results).
*   Sensor health/BIT status.
*   Timestamped data records.
