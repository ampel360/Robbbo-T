## 2. Certification Strategy
### 2.1 Overall Approach
The AMPEL360XWLRGA certification strategy follows a phased approach:
1. **Early Authority Engagement:** Proactive coordination with certification authorities to establish certification basis and special conditions
2. **Incremental Certification:** Progressive demonstration of compliance for conventional systems before novel technologies
3. **Risk-Based Prioritization:** Focus on high-risk areas and novel technologies early in the program
4. **Parallel Certification Paths:** Simultaneous certification activities with multiple authorities
5. **Validation Efficiency:** Lead authority approach with validation by other authorities

### 2.2 Novel Technology Strategy
For novel technologies without established certification standards:
1. **Issue Papers/Certification Review Items:** Early development with authorities
2. **Special Conditions:** Negotiation of appropriate requirements
3. **Means of Compliance:** Development of acceptable methods
4. **Safety Cases:** Comprehensive safety arguments for novel systems
5. **Incremental Testing:** Building confidence through progressive test campaigns
6. **Operational Limitations:** Initial conservative limitations with potential for relaxation

### 2.3 Multi-Authority Strategy
The certification will be pursued with multiple authorities:
- **EASA:** Primary certification authority
- **FAA:** Validation through bilateral agreement
- **CAAC:** Validation for Chinese market
- **Other National Authorities:** As required for target markets

The strategy leverages bilateral agreements and working arrangements between authorities to maximize efficiency and minimize duplication of effort.
