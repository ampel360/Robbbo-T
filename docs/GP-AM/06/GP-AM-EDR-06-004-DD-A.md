## 2. Interior Zoning System

### 2.1 Zoning Principles

The AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft employs a comprehensive interior zoning system to facilitate clear identification, location referencing, and maintenance activities. The zoning system is based on the following principles:

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: The aircraft is divided into major zones, which are further subdivided into sub-zones and specific compartments.
2. **Alphanumeric Identification**: Each zone, sub-zone, and compartment is assigned a unique alphanumeric identifier.
3. **Coordinate Reference**: All zones are referenced to the aircraft coordinate system (FS, BL, WL).
4. **Functional Grouping**: Zones are organized based on functional areas and systems.
5. **Maintenance Accessibility**: Zone boundaries consider maintenance access requirements.
