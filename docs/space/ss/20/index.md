## 3. Metadata & Documentation Standards

To maintain documentation integrity, GAIA SPACE employs a **structured metadata convention** ensuring interoperability across digital tools.

**File-naming standard**
`[Project]-[Domain]-[Chapter]-[Section]-[Subject]-[InfoCode]-[Variant]`

Example → `GAIA-SPACE-SS-20-10-ThermalAnalysis-SPEC-A.yaml` (Thermal analysis, variant A).

Each file must include the **GAIA-CO-ASD-LIB metadata block** with fields for `title`, `documentID`, `revision`, `date`, `status`, `applicability`, `authors`, and so on.

---

## 4. AI & Automation Integration

* **AI-enhanced thermal analysis** for optimized design and testing.
* **Automated regulatory updates** via NLP-driven certification tracking.
* **Semantic search embeddings** for fast retrieval of references.
* **Predictive maintenance analytics** aligned with mission reliability goals.
