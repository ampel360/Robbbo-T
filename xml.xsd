    GAIA AIR embodies a hybrid holistic architecture, merging foundational scientific branches like Heuritm√°tica (uniting physics principles and mathematical theorems) directly into the design and operation of intelligent aerospace systems. The COAFI framework documents this integration, providing traceable links from operational procedures and advanced technologies (AI, Quantum, BNNT) back to their core theoretical underpinnings, enabling unprecedented levels of explainability, optimization, and sustainable performance for robotics, intelligent identities, and next-generation air and space mobility.
